# Digital-Signal-Filtering-Circuit
Project done for Structure of Computer Systems module. It was done in VHDL using AXI4 Streams. It was designed to transform a sequence of input values based on a formula. I chose three formulas: arithmetical average of eight consecutive values, a combination between a high pass and low pass filters and a recurrent fromula.
